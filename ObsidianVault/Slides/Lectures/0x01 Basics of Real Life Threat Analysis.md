 #### Definitions are important
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 26px"-->
- Specialist language facilitates precise communication about complex topics.
- Infosec is full of technical jargon and corporate speak.
- It is also full of marketing teams that make up their own jargon.

 #### Definitions are important
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Unfortunately, unlike Mathematics, there really isn’t a single  (trustworthy!) authority for definitions. 
- There are efforts in place to standardize vocabulary, but you will likely have context dependent jargon based on where you work.

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->

::: title
#### Jargon
:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Military folks, Intelligence community vets, policy wonks, hackers and Punks, all have their own culture, definitions, and slang.
- You will encounter folks with all kinds of ideas and political beliefs.
- Many of whom have large platforms. Some with really bad takes dressed up in legitimizing jargon.

 #### BS Detector 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Infosec is saturated  with BS 
- Infosec evolves rapidly.
- Many people (myself included) constantly feel like they are  behind the curve and playing catch up
- Marketers capitalize on this to make you feel out of the loop :smile:
- spend $>0$ time at a con booth to suffer

#### Definitions

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
#### [[Malware]]
Unwanted, malicious software. 
- It has a bunch of definitions, and can get very meta.
- At the end of the day, it is code that “does a thing” that the person who ran it might not either expect or want.
- Context matters. Is PSExec Malware? Is Slack malware? Is RDP malware? Is Exchange Malware? Is 
Crowdstrike’s  EDR malware?

#### Common activities performed by malware 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Host enumeration: `whoami`, `whereami`, `whatami`
- Network enumeration: what can I talk to, where can I get to?
- Execute: Powershell, Batch, shellcode…etc
- Download: get data onto the computer
- Exfiltrate : get data out of the computer 
- Process Manipulation: start, list, modify, and kill processes
- External Messaging: communicate with an 
external server
- Are these indicators of a malicious program?

 #### PSExec: Goodware?
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 18px"-->
- PSExec is a utility from the sysinternals suite of tools.
- It is used to execute powershell commands/scripts on a remote machine and is incredibly useful for sysadmins 
- It is also 
commonly
 used in offensive cyber operations 
	- Note that it is less common now because it became the 
default
 method for many popular tools, and vendors got good at flagging it. 
	- It is still commonly used by crimeware.

#### Is Crowdstrike’s Agent Malware (Falcon)

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Short answer: No…well kind of but seriously no (don't sue me please). 
- It acts a lot like malware does! If you ever gain control of a 
company's
 Falcon endpoint, they are probably screwed! 
- Falcon is a a set of tools designed to “stop breaches”
- It does so by gathering telemetry, spying on processes, and alerting/responding to activity it deems malicious.

#### A variety of actors conduct cyber operations

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): 
usually associated with Government actors, but any actor conducting cyber operations that can consistently target a set of victims and succeed can fall under this category. 

---

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
Anything that can run code is  susceptible to malware

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Definitions: Common types of malware 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 26px"-->
- Packer:  a tool that compresses, encrypts, and/or modifies an executable usually for the purpose of defense evasion .
- Loader / Dropper: software that downloads and executes other  malicious programs.
- Spreader/Worm:  software designed to spread malicious content on the system/executes the first of the attack. A virus. 
- Miner: malicious software that mines cryptocurrency on a victim machine. 
- Locker/Wiper:  malware that encrypts/destroys files on a victim machine .


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Definitions: Common types of malware 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 26px"-->
- Backdoor: Similar to a loader/dropper but specifically designed to regain access. Usually has less functionality. 
- Spyware/RAT: collections of tools designed to spy on the victim machine that is usually controlled by a remote server. 
- Stealer: Similar to spyware, but generally automatically pillages a computer for all available passwords, crypto wallets...etc  and exits. 
- Implant:  catch all term for malware “implanted” on a victim machine 

---

 #### Definitions: Less common types of malware 

:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 18px"-->
### Rootkit
Generally speaking this is a subclass of spyware. Rootkits are deployed on victim machines that usually have been “rooted” or where the attacker has escalated their privileges on the device. They usually try to hide their existence by hiding (among other things) processes,  network traffic/connections, and files from the OS. Subclasses are defined based on what ring they run in.  
- Is a debugger a rootkit?
- What about Riot Game’s Anti Cheat engine for Valloran?

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### C2 / Command and Control

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Malware is just code. It is created to perform a job, and usually takes its marching orders from, and sends results  to remote servers
- We call these servers Command and Control Servers (C2s) 
- We call the 
mechanism
 that sends data to and from C2 servers the 
C2 Channel
- Note some malware is autonomous (Wanacry)
- Some malware uses P2P communication (Game Over Zeus)
- Some malware is deployed as a larger “Post Exploitation” effort (Cobalt strike anyone?)


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Examples of C2 Channels
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- TCP
- UDP
- ICMP
- HTTP(s)/ HTTP2/HTTP3
- DNS
- TLS handshakes/heartbeats
- Trusted 3rd Parties 
- Other “Exotic” methods

 ## How does Cyber Threat Analysis / Threat Hunting Work? 
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Goal of Threat Hunting

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->

Searching environments to detect and isolate malicious activity.


Analysis/Detection of new malicious activity, creating detection rules, attribution. 

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Goal of Threat Hunting

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
Defensive 
- Finding new phishing emails, figuring out who is targeting your company and why, figuring out how to block malware or the emails from getting to your inbox in the first place. 

Offensive:
- Finding out there’s a bunch of phishing emails that compromised another company in your industry, and emulating the attack on your own company to see if it succeeded.
	- Identifying the actors who carried out the phishing campaign

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Frameworks 

:::
##### There are many frameworks for talking about Cyber Operations. Two popular choices are 
- Lockheed  Martin Cyber Kill Chain 
- MITRE ATT&CK


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Cyber Killchain
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 26px"-->
- Framework for identifying the steps an adversary takes to execute on a tactical objective 
- As defenders, if you can “break a link in the chain” you can disrupt an adversaries operation 


:::

::: right
![[0x01_slide_52_image.png|300]]


:::

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### MITRE ATT&CK

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Similar approach to Cyber Killchain
- Goes into detail about specific TTPs: Tactics, Techniques, and procedures 
- Is an industry standard for talking about how an objective was achieved or how an action was performed
- https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/
- https://attack.mitre.org/resources/faq/
- This course takes many of its definitions from MITRE
- It is far from a perfect framework, but it is another (incredibly useful) tool in your arsenal


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### TTPs: Tactics 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Tactics represent the ‘why’ of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique.
-  It is the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access.”
- Example: Disrupting Iran’s nuclear program


:::

::: right
![[0x01_slide_54_image.png|200]]


:::

---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### TTPs: Techniques
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- “Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access.”
- This includes the tools used, and you will 
sometimes hear me slip up and say 
tactics tools and procedures


:::

::: right

![[0x01_slide_55_image.png|300]]


:::

---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### TTPs: Sub-Technique 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Sub-techniques are a more specific description of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a goal. They describe behavior at a lower level than a technique. For example, an adversary may dump credentials by accessing the Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets.”

:::

::: right
![[0x01_slide_56_image.png|300]]


:::

---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### TTPs: Procedures
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 20px"-->
 Procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques. For example, a procedure could be an adversary using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory on a victim. Procedures are categorized in ATT&CK as the observed in the wild use of techniques in the ‘Procedure Examples’ section of technique pages.”

I like to think of this as “what playbooks does this specific actor use”?

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### This course

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- In this class, we will mostly use MITRE ATT&CK
- It is a useful framework for comparing cyber operations


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### More Definitions

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
### You need to know this
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
 sets of forensic data found when malicious activity occurs. (IPs / domains of a C2 server, hash values of malware, email accounts of phishing email senders..etc)
- Hash value:
 the unique(ish) fingerprint of a single file 
- IP address: 
the address of a computer on a network.
- Domain Name:
 an entry for a A/AAAA record used by a DNS servers to map human friendly names (like google.com) to computer friendly IP addresses (8.8.8.8).
