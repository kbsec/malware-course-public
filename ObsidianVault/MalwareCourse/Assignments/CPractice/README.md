# HW-1
## Prerequisite
If you are unfamiliar with GNU make files, please read the the documentation here  https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction


## C/C++ practice 
- This homework assignment is all about reviewing C.  
- Many of you who have programmed with c in the past likely did so in a POSIX/Linux environment. 
- Linux makes use of LibC as the runtime environment. LibC  implements functions such as `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `memcpy`...etc.
- Windows in the past has implemented many of these functions as part of it's POSIX subsystem. 
- However, after Windows XP, the POSIX subsystem was dropped, and was eventually replaced with what is now the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
- Many of the POSIX c functions are still supported in the Microsoft Visual C Runtime. 
- That said, some functions, such as `opendir` defined in `dirent.h` are only implemented in the Minimal GNU C Compiler on Windows (mingw)  c runtime.  
	- In other words, if you try to import `dirent.h` when using `cl.exe` (Microsoft's C compiler) the compiler will yell at you :-)



Questions 1-5 are meant to be a warm ups/review.  
Question 6 is meant to be difficult but doable. It is something you might see in a cracking-coding interview style problem

### General Directions
Please complete the coding questions as described below. You can find the starter code, and Makefile in the HW1 directory in assignments. 

For this homework, you should not have to modify the Makefile at all, with the exception of the CC (C Compiler) variable depending on your arch.  Note that this will be autograded using Wine and x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-win32. 
When you are satisfied with your submission, please run `make submission` to create a zip archive. 

### Question 1

**Activation**

Malware analyzed in this class will always search for the file `C:\malware\ch0nky.txt`

If the file does not exist, the malware will not run. There will be situations where it will be convenient to create or  delete this file. In particular, if we  want to prevent course malware from running on our device, we could simply delete the file in that directory. To enable the malware to run again, we activate our machine by creating the file. 

In this problem, you will create a command line utility that takes a single argument: either: `activate` or `deactivate`.

If the argument is `activate`,  the program attempts to create  `C:\malware\ch0nky.txt` and write the following string  `"This is testing for fprintf...\n"` (No quotes)
If `deactivate` is set, the program attempts to delete  `C:\malware\ch0nky.txt`. 

For this problem, you must use the POSIX file API contained in `stdio.h`
See https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fopen.htm for more on the API. 
To open a file, use `fopen(filename, mode)` where the `mode` values are identical to those in python.  For example, to create the file in python, we would run 

```python
with open("C:\\malware\\ch0nky.txt", "w+") as f:
	f.write("This is testing for fprintf...\n")
print("Wrote file!")
```

To write data to a file, use `fprintf` defined in  `stdio.h`

### Question 2
**Fibonacci** 
Complete the following code to compute and print  the nth Fibonacci number.
See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) for the definition of what the Fibonacci numbers are.  
- use `atoi` to convert a commandline argument (`char*` into an `int`)
- when printing the value, use `printf("%d\n", nthFib);`
- Explain in the comments why running the binary with argument 47 outputs a negative number. For example 
- `// MY ANSWER HERE: it outputs a negative number because of foo bar`


### Question 3
**MyLS**

Complete the program below to implement a simple version of the `ls` command utility (list files). 
The program should take 1 (optional argument): a path. 
The program then lists all files and directories in the specified path. If none is provided, the default path should be `.`: the current working directory. 
For example 
```powershell
PS C:\dev\AssignmentBank\CPractice> .\myls.exe  C:\malware\
.
..
bginfo.bgi
ch0nky.txt
```


### Question 4
**Greeter**
Create a program that greets every name passed in the the command line, unless their name is "Anakin", in which case, it prints `"ITS OVER ANAKIN! I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND\n"`
Greeting is of the form `Hello there {name}!\n`

Example: 
```powershell
PS C:\dev\AssignmentBank\CPractice> .\highground.exe  Greg Samantha       
Hello there Greg!
Hello there Samantha!
PS C:\dev\AssignmentBank\CPractice> .\highground.exe  Robert Anakin Louis
Hello there Robert!
ITS OVER ANAKIN! I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
Hello there Louis!
```


### Question 5
**Reverse**
Implement a program that reads multiple strings as command line arguments. For each argument, print the reversed value. 
Below is a valid implementation in python.

```python
import sys

for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
	print(arg[::-1])

```


### Question 6 (HARD)
In this problem, you are going to implement the `strings`  utility to parse ASCII strings from arbitrary files.
Here, an ASCII string is any contiguous array of bytes  with minimum byte value 32 and maximum byte value 126 that is *null terminated*. A null terminator is hex value `0x00`, decimal value `0`, and written as a character  literal  `\0`. 

For example, the c string "hello!" is actually an array of chars `char hello[] = {104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33, 0};` with hex values `0x68 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f 0x21 0x00`

Your job is to load the entire file into memory,  and scan it for ASCII strings.
You may assume the maximum file size is 4,294,967,295  bytes (maximum DWORD size.)
To accomplish this, 
- Step 1) Calculate the size of the file. You may use the POSIX c API to seek to the end of the file,  or the Windows API  to calculate the file size.
- Step 2) Read the entire file into a buffer on the Heap. Use `char* buffer = (char*) malloc(file_size)` to allocate enough space for the full file and read the bytes into the buffer.
- step 3) Search the buffer for all ASCII strings  that are at least 4 characters long! Here, is a character is any value in the ASCII range.  For a refresher ASCII, see https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp
	-	Recall you can use python to check encoding of specific characters:
```python
In [2]: chr(100)                                                                   Out[2]: 'd'                                                                       In [3]: ord('d')                                                                   Out[3]: 100                                                                       
```
Each time a string is found, print the string as follows `printf("string>%s</string>\n", str);`
- Note I will be auto-grading this. It is important to ensure that your output is the same format!

Hints:
- You should leverage pointer arithmetic here.
- When calling `printf("%s", str)` recall that `str` is just a char pointer-- in other words, it is a memory address! It will continue writing characters to stdout until it reach a null terminator `\0`.
- Try implementing this in python first if you are having trouble!  see (optional) python starter code 
- Windows Encodes text files as unicode. To test this, feel free to use the code below to generate test cases. 
- Again, the python implementation is totally optional, but also good practice :-)

```python
import os

# make a test file 
def make_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name, "wb+") as f:
        data = b"Hello\0I am a c string!\0I am another c string!\0" + os.urandom(500) + b"I am another c string!\0"
        f.write(data)

# steps 1 and 2 
def load_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name, "rb") as f:
        data = f.read()
    return data

# min/max values
ascii_min = 32
ascii_max = 126
null = 0


# step 3:
# this is a cracking the coding interview style question :)

```
