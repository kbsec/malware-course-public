# HW-2 Crackmes and Baby's First Malware!

# CrackMes
In this homework, you will practice reverse engineering using a time honored tradition of solving "CrackMes". The goal is simple:  find the input that makes it print out "Cracked"

```powershell.exe
PS> crackme.exe "FLAG{IAmAFlag!}"
Cracked!
```


There are 8 Crackmes numbered  0-7, each more challenging than the last! When in doubt consult the flow chart from the static analysis lecture. While you are not expected to complete all of the crackmes,  you should strive to complete at least the first 4.

-  With one exception, ever flag is of the form "Flag{...}".  Make sure to the flag is wrapped in quotes when you test out the binary.

Get started early!


# Baby's First Malware
Please analyze the suspicious sample `ClickMe.exe`

## Static Analysis 

### Hashes
- Compute the SHA256 hash of the binary
- Use the pefile python module to compute the import hash 

### Strings
Search for the strings in the binary. 
Please identify the Command and Control server, and any other IOCs or suspicious strings 

### Finding Main
Assuming the PE is mapped to its preferred address, what is the Virtual Address of the Main function?
