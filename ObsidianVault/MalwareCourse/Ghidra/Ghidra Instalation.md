These directions are designed to work for Ubuntu 22.04. For all other systems, please read the directions here: https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html

- install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
- Grab the release from github 

## Gotchas 

For MacOS, you will need to allow unsigned execution of the [[Ghidra]] Decompiler binary. To do this, navigate to the directory where you installed Ghidra, and enter the following directory `ghidra_10.2.2_PUBLIC/Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/os/mac_x86_64`. Then, open the containing folder: contrl-click the decompiler binary and click `ok` to allow the unsigined executable to be run.  

# Ghidrathon
TLDR: this is a python3 environment for Ghidra that is NOT Jython based. IT relied on JNI so it is **somewhat** unsafe but is perfect for this class.   
Please read the [blog post](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/ghidrathon-snaking-ghidra-python-3-scripting)  and follow the directions [here](https://github.com/mandiant/Ghidrathon#installing-ghidrathon) or  follow the directions in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aatbqf6lcjU)  for installing the plugin.  Make sure to use a  python virtual environment. 

 I provided a script to automate this on Ubuntu, except for the final step of enabling the extension.  In the project menu, click File--> Install Extensions . Select Ghidrathon and click install. It will ask you to restart Ghidra.  Also consider disabling Jython all together.

#### Ghidra Dark Mode 
Allegedly, the NSA is in the process of adding a Dark Mode. Until that happens, this is what I personally use. 
![[lightmode_ghidra.png]]
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zackelia/ghidra-dark.git
python3 ghidra-dark/install.py --path $HOME/ghidra_10.2.2_PUBLIC/
```
