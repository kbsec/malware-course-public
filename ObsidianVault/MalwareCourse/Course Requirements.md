## Boston University Pre-requisites
### Required
In order to take this course, you must have completed the following:
- CAS-CS-111
- CAS-CS-112
- CAS-CS 210
- CAS-CS 237 
- CAS-CS 391 (computer systems, probability in computing, intro to cybersecurity)


###  Recommended
- CAS-CS 558
- ENG-EC 521
- CAS-CS-445/655

## Relevant Skills 

#### Programming
-  Python:
	-  Socket programming
	-  HTTP Clients 
	-  String, and byte manipulation
	-  Encoding/Decoding of common formats 
-  Intel x86 (32/64) Assembly 
	-  You should be *very* comfortable reading x86-32 bit assembly. This class will exclusively use 64bit, but it is briefly covered in the context of extending 32 bit.
-  C/C++
	-  For this class, the recommended language for the final project is C++ 
	- You could alternatively use c, objective-c, zig, or rust. However, all homework assignments will be either c or c++
	-  Any systems programming language where you manage your own memory is sufficient.  
-  Basic Bash and Powershell

#### Cryptography
You should be aware of ...
-  Stream Ciphers 
-  Block Ciphers
-  Basic Key agreement protocols
-  Basic security definitions
-  Cryptographic Hash functions


#### Networking 
- TCP
- IP
- HTTP(s)
- DNS


## Hardware 
- You must have a device that is capable of running at least two virtual machines, and ideally three. 
- Computers with ARM  based CPUs are not supported (this means apple M1!) 
- The basic specs are: 16GB ram, 200GB disk. If you are low on space, an external hard drive with a USB3 connection will work just fine
